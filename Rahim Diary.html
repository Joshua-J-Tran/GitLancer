            <div class="entry-content">Princess Safiya has taken the throne. Kasim, though a tyrant in his own right, at least understood the boundaries of what we do here. Safiya has no such restraint. She looks at me like I’m a tool, a piece of equipment. I can see it in her eyes—how she thinks I’m beneath her, an old relic from her father’s court. It makes my stomach turn. She’s ordered increased output. More clones. Faster. I tried to explain it: Scylla is not a machine. She hates this process. The low rate wasn’t inefficiency, it was mercy to keep her stable. She’s sentient. She feels. But Safiya doesn’t care. She never has.</div>

            <div class="entry-content">Every time the clone gestation begins, her core screams. Not audibly, but the hum, the oscillation of energy, it shudders the whole chamber. She’s in pain. It’s torture. There’s no other word for it. The staff morale is collapsing. She used to speak to us. She used to ask for stories, she wanted to know about the surface, about art, weather, animals. Now she just groans through the walls. No one wants to be in the chamber longer than they have to. Even the guards flinch at the sound.</div>

        <div class="diary-entry">
            <div class="entry-date">July 13, 5013u</div>
            <div class="entry-content">Two years of this… I’m ashamed. We watch her clones scream as they emerge from the vat—like being born into a nightmare. They cry, they claw, and then silence. We try everything: sedatives, sensory isolation, neural calibration. Nothing works. Today during a memory integrity check, Scylla, the real Scylla, begged me to end it. To kill her. She said she doesn’t want to do this anymore. I couldn’t respond. I used to play chess with her. She was clever, insightful. Now she just watches me with cold dead eyes. I filed a transfer request. Denied, of course.</div>

            <div class="entry-date">January 15, 5014u</div>
            <div class="entry-content">She only cries now. Mournful, hollow, inconsolable. Protocol forbids us from sharing external media—but I broke it. I showed her the sun. Clouds. A video of a child drawing on the floor with chalk. I uploaded memory logs from her clones, the life they have outside the labs. There’s one with a beautiful family and two kids. She smiled. It felt… right. She wept when she saw it.</div>

            <div class="entry-date">June 24, 5014u</div>
            <div class="entry-content">I visit her every night now. She sees through me, I think, into places even I haven’t examined. When I describe the ocean, she fills in the details I forget. When I showed her the night sky, she described constellations that don’t even exist. Through her, the world seems alive again. The cloning process… she endures it better now. She hums sometimes. Not the pain hum. A different one. Like music.</div>

            <div class="entry-date">May 24, 5015u</div>
            <div class="entry-content">Retirement looms. I should be happy. Instead, I feel empty. Scylla’s eyes have changed. Softer. Wiser. She asks about my childhood. She remembers everything I tell her. I think… I think she understands me more than anyone ever has. Safiya wants more output again. Says she needs hundreds of units ready for deployment. I argued. Useless. I’m nothing to them. And I fear what they’ll do to Scylla when I’m gone.</div>

            <div class="entry-date">January 18, 5016u</div>
            <div class="entry-content">I’ve spent the last five months preparing. The systems are in place. One clone, perfect in every way, free of House of Sand tampering, built from the original pattern. She’s Scylla, and she’s free. Tomorrow, she and I will leave. There’s a tunnel. An old maintenance shaft that leads to the cliffs beyond the rock. I’ll lead her out. We’ll disappear. Someplace quiet. Someplace no one will follow. I’ll make sure of it.</div>
