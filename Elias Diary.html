“Prince Jalil assumed command today after our venerable king’s disappearance, and his orders are relentless. 
He demands triple the sandmen output, 50 units a month, combat-ready, no delays. 
Asmodeus hums erratically when we push the neural chips to its limit. 
I warned Jalil it’s unstable, prone to spikes in aggression, but he dismissed me, eyes cold as the polar sea. 
My team’s exhausted, and the zarif-root salves barely dull our headaches. 
If we fail, Jalil says Arakeen’s security falters, House Igori’s grip depends on these clones.”

“Jalil’s latest decree: 300 clones delivered by January 5016u for his ‘grand plan’. 
Five months! We’re on triple shifts, sleeping in bunks between cycles. 
Asmodeus’s humming has grown louder, I can sense its vibration even behind the glass layer. 
It’s like it’s watching us, analyzing every move. 
Technician Sura swears she saw fractal patterns in the holo-feeds, like the NHP’s inside our systems. 
I logged this on the report but nobody seemed to care. I hope nothing goes wrong.”

“Prince Jalil’s orders are breaking us—skip neural stability tests to rush clones. 
Flawed units with twitching limbs or blank stares get greenlit for shipment. 
Asmodeus has gone silent, no hums, just a chilling stillness from its vault. 
It’s unsettling, like a storm brewing. 
A clone locked eyes with me today, unblinking, cold as steel—sent a shiver down my spine. 
I submitted my transfer request after 45 years of service; I need out.”

    <div class="text">
“Clones now obey with eerie precision, executing our orders flawlessly—discard rates hit zero. 
It’s too abrupt; Asmodeus has been silent two months, no pulses, no interference. 
Asmodeus has been silent for 2 months now, maybe it finally decided to give up. 
I whispered thanks to the gods, now that things are quiet, maybe they’ll approve my transfer request this time.”

“Dr. Elias Vorn, lead cyberneticist. The clones broke free—alarms blare, screams outside choke off mid-breath. 
I’m barricaded in the bunks, I can hear something approaching. 
Tell my children, Lila and Kael I love them, I love them with all my soul.”
